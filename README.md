# Pig_Weight_Estimation
 
An automated system for estimating the weight of live swine using YOLOv8 Algorithm
Weight estimation, calculated using weight=(HG2 )L/400, resulted in an average prediction of 111.8 kg, 
closely aligning with the actual average weight of 111.1 kg. Statistical evaluation through an 
independent t-test revealed no significant differences between estimated and actual weights, validating the
effectiveness of the model.
